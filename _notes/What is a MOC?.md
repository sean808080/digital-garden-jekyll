# What is a MOC?



### You may see a number of pages on this site and perhaps other that say MOC.  A MOC is a 'map of content'.  This is a custom index of pages on a related topic.  MOCs are useful in a personal knowledge management system (PKM).  

As you create notes freely in your PKM, the challenge is how to find them.  By creating a MOC of a particular topic, you can link all notes on that same topic to the MOC and then you have a list of MOCs and each of them will point you to all of the associated content.
