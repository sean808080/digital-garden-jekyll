# Tennessee Williams 
` “You’ll become a better writer and person when you realize how brief and brutal and glorious life is. I promise you’ll develop a filter and the filter is art, and the filter will burn through the brutality; the art will use it as kindling. Look back for the people walking the same path you got through and extend a hand.”
