##### I used facebook for a number of years but it was during the election cycle of 2016 that I realized it was not good for my mental health.  
I deleted my facebook and can't say I miss it.  There is definitely psychological resistance that gets in the way of actually doing it.  Once you click the button, that fades quickly as the anxiety you were experiencing fades.
