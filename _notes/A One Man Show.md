- That reminds me
	- Of the first time I saw this image.  It was at a record store in Los Angeles. It must have been 1980 or so.  I was struck by this androgynous, larger than life, and striking image.  It stayed with me for sure.  Similar to the first time I laid eyes on [Debbie Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry) of Blondie.  Those moments make a big impression on a young man.
